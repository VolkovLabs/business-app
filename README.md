## Introduction

The Business App includes a Docker image with customized Grafana and an application plugin.

## Customization

Months of work bundled with deep expertise nicely wrapped into a 7-minute long video revealing simple steps to customize Grafana. In this tutorial, we answered all community questions we collected to this moment.
